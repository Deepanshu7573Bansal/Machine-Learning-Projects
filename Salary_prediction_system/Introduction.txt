In salary prediction system project i use some concept of Machine learning, General python, and Streamlit.

Jupiter notebook:
In jupiter notebook i write a code step by step.
step1: Import library(such numpy, pandas).
step2: Read csv file.
step3: check null values, drop unuseful columns, duplicate rows.
step4: Remone na(null) rows.
step5: Assign different column to different variable(to calculation in prediction function).
step6: Create prediction function to make prediction.
In step6 all input values compare according to their columns data. Then check experience and calculate(average,mean).
step7: Print output

Note: In this model, dataset it too small and mostly row is unique job title(so model is not good).
